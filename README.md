##  Music Hits Regression Project 
### *Predicting Peak Performance on Billboard Hot 100*


This project utilizes [Billboard Hot 100 data](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 "Billboard Hot 100") and [Spotify's song Web API data](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ "Spotify Web API") to build a model that predicts how high a song can reach on Billboard's Hot 100 according to certain attributes. 

The workflow follows the building of several models (including lasso & ridge models, models with feature engineering, etc.), all of which are ultimately compared with cross validation to pick and finalize the best model.

The model building notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/mehiks11/MusicHits_Project/blob/master/MusicHits%20Model%20Building.ipynb "Modeling Notebook") .

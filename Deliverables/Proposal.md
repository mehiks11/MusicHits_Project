This regression analysis project will use web scraping to develop data frames with mutliple song attributes from songs that have enterted the billboard top 200. The goal is to provide insight on what differentiates songs with lower rankings on the billboard 200 from ones with higher rankings. The billboard 200 is typically made up of already popular artists, artists with high followings, which have typically been built over time. However, songs by relatively smaller artists still enter the billboard. 

The attributes we will be fitting a model according to include artist number analytics including number of spotify followers, monthly listeners, and recording label, as well as song attributes unrelated to the artist specifically, including length, key, BPM, and genre. 

The data will be gathered by scraping multiple websites, including billboard, notediscover, and wikipedia, combined with API data from spotify. The project will span several months of billboard charts, enough to gather enough unique data points to create a more reliable model.

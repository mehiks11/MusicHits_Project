1. Scrape ten? weeks of songs with a month of time in between from **billboard**. (~2500 data points)
    * Obtain: *Song name, Artist, Peak Ranking*
2. Create a data frame with Song name, Artist, Peak Ranking
3. Create a list of song names for iteration
4. Create a function that generically grabs *genre, length*, and *record label* from **wikipedia** and appends that dictionary with those values onto a list
5. Use selenium to search every song name from the song list on **wikipedia** with the author name, click the first link, and run the above function 
6. Create a function that generically grabs *key* and *BPM* from **notediscover**
7. Use selenium to search every song name from song list on google search + notediscover, click on first link, and run above function
